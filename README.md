# ZonalLongterm

This repository contains the source code and datasets of the paper *[An analysis of zonal electricity markets from a long-term persepective](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.105853)* by Quentin Lété, Yves Smeers and Anthony Papavasiliou. 

The models are capacity expansion models based on three different short-term market designs: locational marginal pricing (nodal), flow-based market coupling and zonal with price aggregation. 
An algorithm based on the splitting method is used to solve the decentralized FBMC model, represented as a linear complementarity problem.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Julia v1.5.2, depending on Julia packages listed in Project.toml. The execution requires a working installation and license of mathematical programming solver Gurobi (v9). 

## Usage
The figures and tables of the paper can be generated by executing the command
`julia ZonalLongterm.jl`
from the src folder.
